### What it does
Food Finder allows the ability to search for any type of cuisine in an area you specify. All you have to do is set your location and then tell it what you want to eat. It will also include searches based upon your dietary restrictions, if any.

To start it, say something like: 'Open Food Finder'. If it is your first time using it, it will then prompt you to choose your default location, which you can tell it. With this new information, you can start asking it for cuisines!

After setting a location, you can say: 'I want to eat'. Which then brings you to a dialog between Food Finder and yourself, asking for dietary restrictions, if any. If you do, you can mention it, if not, you can say none. If you want to change locations, you can simply say: change location.

Finally, after saying the choice of food and any dietary restriction, Food Finder will then tell you the best place to eat or get that food you want.

### How it works
Food Finder utilizes the Yelp API to search for any cuisine the user asks for and returns the result. If it is the users first time using this skill, it will prompt for the location; if there is no location set, the default location will always be Los Angeles, CA. There is currently four different ways to customize the search results: the food requested, the type of food, price, and by location.
